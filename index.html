"For every finger you point, there are three pointing back." 

It is important to make extra sure you want to accuse or call out someone, or even cause a situation at all. The 3:1 ratio is meant as a joke at first, but implies you be more than equally judgemental on yourself first. It is embarrassing to be wrong, especially the more you defend or support your claim after it's made. Every "aw huh" adds to how foolish you can look once you're proven wrong. And in the age of communication, the chances of being proven are very high. 

"Adult words are only for adults and you will get in trouble if an adult hears you." 

Right away, this passes the buck to any or all other adults. This also excuses anytime you or any adult says an adult word. Of course, I like to remind my kids that it isn't polite and should only be for serious occasions. Although, I should clarify "rare" situations. Things like music, gaming, movies, and TV all have potential for adult words anymore.

A fungus that eats Mars dust, and makes oxygen

In a lab in Germany, researchers have found something remarkable: a fungus that not only survives in simulated Martian soil, but also produces breathable oxygen as it breaks down toxic compounds.

The engineered strain, Cladosporium sphaerospermum, was designed to handle Martian extremes: low moisture, harsh UV, and a soil rich in perchlorates (which are toxic to humans). When placed under red light and grown in Mars-like conditions, the fungus started feeding on these perchlorates, and released oxygen as a byproduct.

Over several weeks, sealed test chambers recorded a steady rise in oxygen levels, enough to support insect life. Even better, the fungus grew biofilms that stabilized loose Martian dust, which can be dangerous to both machines and lungs.

Why this matters:
◾ Converts toxic soil into usable oxygen
◾ Reduces dust hazards in enclosed habitats
◾ Self replicates and forms radiation-resistant biomass
◾ Could be integrated into greenhouses, walls, or recycling systems

This isn’t science fiction. It’s a living system that could one day make Mars more livable, by using what’s already there. We might not have to terraform Mars. Life is already figuring it out.
