Quotes
Monty Python's the Meaning of Life
[the End Of The Film]
Lady Presenter: Well, that's the end of the film. Now, here's the meaning of life.
[Receives an envelope]
Lady Presenter: Thank you, Brigitte.
[Opens envelope, reads what's inside]
Lady Presenter: M-hmm. Well, it's nothing very special. Uh, try and be nice to people, avoid eating fat, read a good book every now and then, get 
some walking in, and try and live together in peace and harmony with people of all creeds and nations. And, finally, here are some completely 
gratuitous pictures of penises to annoy the censors and to hopefully spark some sort of controversy, which, it seems, is the only way, these days, 
to get the jaded, video-sated public off their fucking arses and back in the sodding cinema. Family entertainment? Bollocks. What they want is 
filth: people doing things to each other with chainsaws during tupperware parties, babysitters being stabbed with knitting needles by gay 
presidential candidates, vigilante groups strangling chickens, armed bands of theatre critics exterminating mutant goats. Where's the fun in 
pictures? Oh, well, there we are. Here's the theme music. Goodnight. -->

        Let's get political. To understand my perspective, you might check out the Concerns and Thoughts (CATs), my YouTube playlists on Religion and Politics, 
        my various social media accounts, or just simply ask me. I'm going to try and maintain current links to all of that on this website. If something
        isn't working or isn't there, please comment that with a link to any of my YouTube videos. I will see those best, as will the whole world. My public 
        facing email is checked, but not often and will most likely be wrought with spam that I'll be investigating and reporting to the feds.

        This is your warning: The US Federal Government watches my content. I am on multiple official watchlists for cyber security knowledge. I have taken
        undergrad classes as well as completed a 6 month intensive cyber security boot camp from Colorado State University and FullStack Academy. I swore
        the White Hat Manifesto oath to use my powers only for good, or face the consequences of betraying my trust and my word.

      <p>You can also comment on any of the Google Docs. The CATs and the BV Accord are the best Google Docs to do so at this time. There, anyone is free

    <h1>The Mission</h1>
    <p>
      I am a former overhead crane operator and first-aid responder from Buena Vista, Colorado, who realized that if we can move 
      massive industrial loads with precision, we can move the needle on world peace with the same logic. I’m here to broker the 
      BV Accord: a global transition from destroying what we fear to building what we need.
    </p>
    <h1>The Credentials (The "Stone Soup" Chef)</h1>
    <p>
      Heavy Logistics: Years spent spotting and operating cranes. I understand how to move the "big stuff" when lives are on the 
      line.
    </p>
    <h1>Tactical Humility</h1>
    <p>
      A veteran of the "mental breakdown" and "medication mismanagement" wars. I’ve seen the "hot seat," and I’ve survived the 
      shame. I’m now using that experience to build the Global Confessional.
    </p>
    <h1>Market Research</h1>
    <p>
      I’ve spent years "Verbal Kung Fu" testing these ideas on the world’s toughest audiences—from black ops soldiers to digital 
      trolls.
    </p>
    <h11>The Blueprint: </h11>
    <p>
      Architect of CommunL and the Voluntrophy system.
    </p>
      <h1>The Philosophy: "Non Prickus Maximus"</h1>
    <p>
      I believe that Respect is the only sustainable currency and that Satire is the only weapon that doesn’t leave a body count. 
      Whether it’s fixing the migrant crisis with President Trump and President Sheinbaum or turning the Cartels into construction 
      crews, I’m betting on the "Christmas Miracle" of human connection.

    <h1>Message to Russia</h1>
    <h3>Russian Version</h3>
    <p>
      «Руководству и народу России: Мы знаем, что сила — ваша валюта. Но эпоха «взаимного гарантированного уничтожения» — 
      это игра стариков. Мы приглашаем вас присоединиться к Соглашению BV. Вместо того чтобы доказывать силу сталью и свинцом, 
      докажите ее очагом. Мы приглашаем вас присоединиться к таблице лидеров Voluntrophy. Помогите нам построить «Общий 
      европейско-азиатский дом». Пусть ваши инженеры и мастера логистики возглавят строительство мира, в котором ни один ребенок 
      не замерзнет и не будет голодать. В Llama Lounge мы все признаем свои ошибки, смеемся, а затем строим. Сила — в защите жизни, 
      а не в ее отнятии».
    </p>
    
    <h3>English Version</h3>
    <p>
      "To the leadership and people of Russia: We know that strength is your currency. But the era of 'Mutually Assured Destruction' 
      is an old man's game. We invite you to join the BV Accord. Instead of proving strength through steel and lead, prove it through 
      the hearth. We invite you to join the Voluntrophy Leaderboard. Help us build the 'Common European-Asian Home.' Let your engineers 
      and logistics masters lead the construction of a world where no child freezes or hungers. In the Llama Lounge, we all admit our 
      mistakes, we laugh, and then we build. Strength is protecting life, not taking it."
    </p>

    <h1>Message to China</h1>
    <h3>Chinese Version</h3>
    <p>
      “致中国领导层：你们谈到‘人类命运共同体’。BV 协议就是那个未来的蓝图。我们邀请你们降低‘防火墙’，以换取‘伟大的基础’。
      你们无与伦比的基础设施建设能力是我们‘石头汤’中缺失的成分。加入全球 Voluntrophy 系统。与其争夺领土，
      不如让我们通过共同消除贫困和饥饿来竞争‘天命’。在 Llama Lounge 中，透明度不是威胁；它是通往大同（Datong）
      的道路。让我们以前所未有的速度建设这个世界。”
    </p>
    
    <h3>English Version</h3>
    <p>
      "To the leadership of China: You speak of a 'Community with a Shared Future for Mankind.' The BV Accord is the blueprint for 
      that future. We invite you to lower the 'Great Firewall' in exchange for the 'Great Foundation.' Your unmatched ability to 
      build infrastructure is the missing ingredient in our Stone Soup. Join the global Voluntrophy system. Instead of competing 
      for territory, let us compete for the 'Mandate of Heaven' by ending poverty and hunger together. In the Llama Lounge, 
      transparency is not a threat; it is the path to universal respect (Datong). Let us build the world faster than we ever 
      thought possible."

      <p>
        Before you try to solve problems for and with others, you need to make sure you're at least trying 
        to solve your own problems. There are gains from trade, including mental health support! Respect 
         others and they'll respect you back. Mental health relies on both how you treat others and how
        you treat yourself.

      <h1>The importance of physical health</h1>
      <p>
        Physical health is also important. Without proper movement and exercise, the human body will 
        start having avoidable problems. Simple things like daily stretching or exercises like Tai Chi
        can vastly improve one's physical health. Regular intensive exercise like running, weight lifting, 
        resistance training will also improve one's physical health.

         Teach Scalable Solutions to Ensure Lifelong Prosperity

"For every finger you point, there are three pointing back." 

It is important to make extra sure you want to accuse or call out someone, or even cause a situation at all. The 3:1 ratio is meant as a joke at first, but implies you be more than equally judgemental on yourself first. It is embarrassing to be wrong, especially the more you defend or support your claim after it's made. Every "aw huh" adds to how foolish you can look once you're proven wrong. And in the age of communication, the chances of being proven are very high. 

"Adult words are only for adults and you will get in trouble if an adult hears you." 

Right away, this passes the buck to any or all other adults. This also excuses anytime you or any adult says an adult word. Of course, I like to remind my kids that it isn't polite and should only be for serious occasions. Although, I should clarify "rare" situations. Things like music, gaming, movies, and TV all have potential for adult words anymore.

A fungus that eats Mars dust, and makes oxygen

In a lab in Germany, researchers have found something remarkable: a fungus that not only survives in simulated Martian soil, but also produces breathable oxygen as it breaks down toxic compounds.

The engineered strain, Cladosporium sphaerospermum, was designed to handle Martian extremes: low moisture, harsh UV, and a soil rich in perchlorates (which are toxic to humans). When placed under red light and grown in Mars-like conditions, the fungus started feeding on these perchlorates, and released oxygen as a byproduct.

Over several weeks, sealed test chambers recorded a steady rise in oxygen levels, enough to support insect life. Even better, the fungus grew biofilms that stabilized loose Martian dust, which can be dangerous to both machines and lungs.

Why this matters:
◾ Converts toxic soil into usable oxygen
◾ Reduces dust hazards in enclosed habitats
◾ Self replicates and forms radiation-resistant biomass
◾ Could be integrated into greenhouses, walls, or recycling systems

This isn’t science fiction. It’s a living system that could one day make Mars more livable, by using what’s already there. We might not have to terraform Mars. Life is already figuring it out.
