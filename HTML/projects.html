<!-- Reg: All right, but apart from the sanitation, medicine, education, wine, public order, irrigation, roads, the fresh water system and public health, what have the Romans ever done for us?
Attendee: Brought peace?
Reg: Oh, peace - shut up!
Reg: There is not one of us who would not gladly suffer death to rid this country of the Romans once and for all.
Dissenter: Uh, well, one.
Reg: Oh, yeah, yeah, there's one. But otherwise, we're solid. -->

      Gang Violence
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Without barriers to higher education, many gangsters would rather pursue a better life.</li>
      <li>Without crippling debt, gangsters could afford the finer things in life. Then, there's no reason to be gangsters, except during puberty when kiddos are just crazy anyway.</li>
      <li>By ending the War on Drugs, you take away the biggest part of being a gangster: power and control through narcotics.</li>
      <li>Through treatment and not incarceration, we can change an entire generation to forward thinkers and new Ben Franklins.</li>
      <li>Locking people in cages and branding them as lifelong felons is barbaric.</li>
      <li>Many of us are Ex-Felons. We don't break the law anymore, so enough is enough.</li>
      <li>I want gun rights reinstated. Not because I want to own guns, but because I want my freedom back. (I have thousands of items in my house I can kill an intruder with. I want zero items my kids can kill an intruder with.)</li>
      <li></li>
