<!-- Reg: All right, but apart from the sanitation, medicine, education, wine, public order, irrigation, roads, the fresh water system and public health, what have the Romans ever done for us?
Attendee: Brought peace?
Reg: Oh, peace - shut up!
Reg: There is not one of us who would not gladly suffer death to rid this country of the Romans once and for all.
Dissenter: Uh, well, one.
Reg: Oh, yeah, yeah, there's one. But otherwise, we're solid. -->

      Gang Violence
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Without barriers to higher education, many gangsters would rather pursue a better life.</li>
      <li>Without crippling debt, gangsters could afford the finer things in life. Then, there's no reason to be gangsters, except during puberty when kiddos are just crazy anyway.</li>
      <li>By ending the War on Drugs, you take away the biggest part of being a gangster: power and control through narcotics.</li>
      <li>Through treatment and not incarceration, we can change an entire generation to forward thinkers and new Ben Franklins.</li>
      <li>Locking people in cages and branding them as lifelong felons is barbaric.</li>
      <li>Many of us are Ex-Felons. We don't break the law anymore, so enough is enough.</li>
      <li>I want gun rights reinstated. Not because I want to own guns, but because I want my freedom back. (I have thousands of items in my house I can kill an intruder with. I want zero items my kids can kill an intruder with.)</li>

      Society: Compare and contrast Star Wars and Star Trek. Boss vs Leader? How do we get to the "Star Trek Era" of global unity and cooperation? Cashless society where humanity's progression and ensured survival is the reward?

      Fix the Housing Crisis
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Create law where "first dibs" goes to people who will use the property as their primary residence.</li>
      <li>Tax rental companies with more than X amount of rental properties.</li>
      <li>Waive the above tax if these companies "come to their senses" and convert some / all properties to "Rent to Own"</li>
      <li>This might sound like "punishment" for exploiting the lower class...and it is! Lol</li>

      Cashless Society
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>We're already on our way to that. As long as we are busy learning or working, someone adds funds to our accounts.</li>
      <li>Think "Templates." It doesn't matter who the source is, as long as the work is being done. Education is training for more advanced work.</li>
      <li>We leverage imaginary money to ensure cooperation from each citizen.</li>
