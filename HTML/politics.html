<!-- Reg: All right, but apart from the sanitation, medicine, education, wine, public order, irrigation, roads, the fresh water system and public health, what have the Romans ever done for us?
Attendee: Brought peace?
Reg: Oh, peace - shut up!
Reg: There is not one of us who would not gladly suffer death to rid this country of the Romans once and for all.
Dissenter: Uh, well, one.
Reg: Oh, yeah, yeah, there's one. But otherwise, we're solid. -->

<p>
      Possible improvements for USA Politics
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Rewrite Constitution to simply change the words "men" to "people." This fixes multiple Amendments into the base Constitution. Amendments are slightly offensive anyway, more like afterthoughts than actual law.</li>
      <li>Term limits</li>
      <li>Upper Age Limits</li>
      <li>Require all politicians to submit their tax documents regularly / have them open to the public</li>
      <li>Outlaw all other forms of profiting off of politics</li>
      <li>Outlaw stock trading while in office</li>
      <li>Eliminate Proxy Voting - if you're hired to do a job, you do your job</li>
      <li>Expand mail-in voting to all citizens</li>
      <li>Increase accountability staff from all political parties</li>
      <li>Ministry of Accountability!</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      Ministry of Accountability
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>There is already a form of this at: </li>
      <li>Keep record of every voting history for each politician</li>
      <li>Explain in basic English what each law meant</li>
      <li>Make each explanation of a law up-votable and down-votable, but not erasable (unless it contains foul language or false information...then maybe just edit it and still keep it if salvageable)</li>
    </ul>
