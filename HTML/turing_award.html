Today, we remember James Hardy Wilkinson, who was born hashtag#OTD in 1919. He received the 1970 hashtag#ACMTuringAward 
for his research in numerical analysis to facilitate the use of the high-speed digital computer, having received special 
recognition for his work in computations in linear algebra and "backward" error analysis. 

At the end of World War II, Wilkinson joined the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) and worked with Alan Turing on his 
proposal to build an electronic computer. When Turing left the NPL to go to Manchester University, Wilkinson helped 
continue to develop Turingâ€™s computer, the Pilot ACE, which became operational in 1950. More on Wilkinson, here:
