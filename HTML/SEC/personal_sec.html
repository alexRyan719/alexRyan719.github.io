    <h3>What's the Point?</h3>
      <p>We are all people. We all think the same ways. We all deserve to be respected as
      people.</p>

    <h1>Personal - Self Security</h1>

      <p>If you don't take care of yourself, you're a risk to yourself and others.</p>

    <h1>Key points to consider and focus effort on</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>Hungry / Food</li>
      <li>Tired / Sleep</li>
      <li>Primed | Prepared to be angry / Previous | Pre existing  situations or emotions </li>
      <li>Rich | Poor / Finances | Perspective</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>The Serenity Prayer</h1>

    <p>
      The most common form of the Serenity Prayer is: "God, grant me the serenity to accept the 
      things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference". 
      Attributed to theologian Reinhold Niebuhr, the prayer became widely known through its use in 
      the 12-step program of Alcoholics Anonymous and serves as a spiritual guide for navigating 
      life's challenges by distinguishing between what is within our control and what is not.
