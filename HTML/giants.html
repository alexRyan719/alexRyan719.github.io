    <h1>If I have seen further than others, it is by standing 
      upon the shoulders of giants</h1>

    <p>
      The quote, “If I have seen further than others, it is by standing 
      upon the shoulders of giants” (attributed to Sir Isaac Newton), is 
      famously featured on the Colorado State University campus. This 
      quote is part of the “Newton’s Corner” public art installation, a 
      3-foot polished stainless-steel sphere located near the Morgan 
      Library.
