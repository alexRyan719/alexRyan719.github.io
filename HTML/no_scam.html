<!-- Man in Pink: [singing] Whenever life gets you down Mrs. Brown / and things seem hard or tough / and people are stupid, 
obnoxious or daft / and you feel that you've had quite enough! / just remember that your standing on a planet thats evolving 
/ revolving at nine-hundred miles an hour / its orbiting at ninety miles a second / so its reckoned / a sun that is the 
source of all our power / the sun and you and me / and all the stars that we can see / are moving at a million miles a day 
/ in an outer spiral arm at forty-thousand miles an hour / of the galaxy we call the Milky Way / Our galaxy itself / contains
a hundred billion stars / its a hundred thousand lightyears side to side / it bulges in the middle / sixteen-thousand lightyears 
thick / but out by us its just three-thousand lightyears wide / were thirty-thousand lightyears from galatic central point / we 
go round every two-hundred-million years / and our galaxy is only one of millions of billions in this amazing and expanding universe.

[musical interlude]
Man in Pink: The universe itself keeps on expanding and expanding / in all of the directions it can whiz / as fast as it can go 
/ the speed of light you know / twelve million miles a minute and thats the fastest speed there is / so remember when your feeling
very small and insecure / how amazingly unlikely is your birth / and pray that there intelligent life somewhere up in space / cause 
theres bugger all down here on Earth.

Mrs. Brown: [sigh] Makes you feel so, sort of, insignificant, doesn't it?

Dr. Spenser: Can we have your liver, then?

Mrs. Brown: Yes, alright, you talked me into it. -->

      Math Blaster was one of my favorite learning tools. It was an early example of gameification.
