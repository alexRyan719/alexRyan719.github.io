      Mental Health, Why Does it Matter?
    </h1>

    <p>
      It's similar to riding on an airplane and the oxygen masks come down. You are supposed
      to put yours on first before trying to help your children or other passengers. 

      To be succesful in life and society, one needs to maintain at least a certain level self 
      maintenance.

      My personal experience with mental health and mental wellness
    </h1>

    <p>
      First off, most mental health or mental wellness issues are temporary and manageable. There is often
      someone out there having a harder time than you. This also changes constantly for most situations. 
      However, there are people that have to life with certain problems or factors. I learned Hunter Safety,
      or Gun Safety from a man that was missing both legs and a hand from a grenade explosion.
