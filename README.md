This is my first attempt to host a website on Github. I would like to develop ideas like Online Voting, Math Blaster tributes, Political and Religious Analysis tools. Sort of like a MySpace, but with debates with relevant sources / arguments / specific information like funding. 

TODO 10 / 10 / 25:
 CTC - Add planning for virtual town halls and discussions with experts and record the best few. Allow for at will verification of concerns. Squash the conspiracy theories through understanding and patience. 
 CTC - Locate where to find transcripts of presidential speeches, addresses, etc

TODO 10 / 14
 Add section on community awareness of things like insurance - communal combatting of scams, fraud, and otherwise bad things.  
 Add reasoning for "why do you do this?" - Done
