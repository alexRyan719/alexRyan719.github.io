This is my first attempt to host a website on Github. I would like to develop ideas like Online Voting, Math Blaster tributes, Political and Religious Analysis tools. Sort of like a MySpace, but with debates with relevant sources / arguments / specific information like funding. 

TODO 10 / 10 / 25:
 Add planning for virtual town halls and discussions with experts and record the best few. Allow for at will verification of concerns. Squash the conspiracy theories through understanding and patience.
